    "First, the file contatining initial sample data is opened and read in line-by-line using the [`rstrip()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_rstrip.asp) method. Each line is further split into seperate values using the [`split()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp) method. This effectively makes a list of 2-entry lists. \n",

This is done by iterating over the lists in `raw_data` and copying the first value of each list into the `x_data` array and the second value into the `y_data` array. Each entry must also be cast to float, as each entry is initially considered a string when read in from the file."
